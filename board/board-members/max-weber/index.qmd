Max Weber (1864--1920) was a pioneering German sociologist, philosopher, and political economist, best known for his profound impact on the study of sociology and his theories on capitalism, bureaucracy, and religion. Born in Erfurt, Prussia, Weber grew up in an intellectually vibrant environment, which significantly influenced his scholarly pursuits.

Weber studied law, history, economics, and philosophy at several universities, including Heidelberg and Berlin. His early academic career focused on law and economics, but he soon shifted to broader social sciences. He became a professor at the University of Freiburg and later at the University of Heidelberg.

Weber's most influential work, "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" (1905), argued that Protestant ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He is also known for his theory of bureaucracy, which described an ideal type of bureaucracy based on rational-legal authority, hierarchical structure, and formal rules and procedures.

Beyond his academic contributions, Weber was actively involved in politics and participated in the drafting of the Weimar Constitution after World War I. His later works, such as "Economy and Society" and "Politics as a Vocation," continued to explore the complexities of modern society, authority, and individual agency.

Weber's comprehensive approach to sociology, which integrated economic, political, and cultural dimensions, has left a lasting legacy, making him a foundational figure in the field. He passed away in Munich in 1920, but his ideas continue to influence sociological thought and research.
