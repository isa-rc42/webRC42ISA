    "section": "",
    "text": "Knowing Justice in the Anthropocene\nThe 5th ISA Forum of Sociology will take place in Rabat, Morocco on July 6-11, 2025. This is the first ISA Forum to be held in the region and specifically in a country that is known for being at the crossroads of civilizations spanning the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Africa. This unique geographic location, and the campus of Mohammed V University where we will be hosted, is the perfect setting for the intense intellectual debates that are foreseen around the theme “Knowing Justice in the Anthropocene”. The dates of the Forum provide us with the opportunity to engage these debates in our Forum and in a sociological film festival that will be open to the public, just before the city will turn its gaze from sociology to football as host of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\nThe Forum will bring together sociologists from around the world to unpack this complex theme. Our point of departure lies in the recognition of the Anthropocene and the environmental concerns that accompany it. This word entered our lexicon at the turn of the Millennium when geologists first began to identify what they considered to be irreversible geological traces of human societies on the planet. In March 2024, the ‘scientists’ (according to a New York Times reporter) decided that no, we were not really in a new geological epoch. But the journalist noted that the term had already gained so much importance in anthropology and history that it will most likely stay relevant in societies. This situation of contested knowledges is precisely what we will tackle in Rabat.\nWhat does it mean to “know” in the context of the Anthropocene? Whose knowledge counts? What forms of knowing (understood in its feminist and relational sense) are prioritized, and with what consequences, in societal change? While some sub-disciplines have been actively contributing to academic and public debates, sociology writ large has not been at the center of these debates regarding the conditions of living with and in the Anthropocene. How might engaging the sociological imagination in discussions of the Anthropocene better equip sociologists and citizens to contribute to these public debates about our individual and collective capacities to live together in such an epoch?\nThis brings us to the question of justice. How do we know what is fair and just? Can we forge new understandings of justice for the Anthropocene? What can sociology contribute to how we know justice among knowledges (ontological and epistemic justice) or about aspects of our social worlds, such as environmental justice, legal justice, transitional justice, land justice, water justice, interspecies justice, racial justice, ethnic justice, or gender justice? What new questions are opened about these types of relations when the conditions of the Anthropocene are taken seriously?\nThis broad theme provides a space for dialogue within and across ISA’s 67 Research Committees (RCs), Working Groups (WGs), and Thematic Groups (TGs). We invite all sociologists from all walks of life and all corners of the earth to join us in Rabat in 2025!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Max Weber (1864–1920) was a pioneering German sociologist, philosopher, and political economist, best known for his profound impact on the study of sociology and his theories on capitalism, bureaucracy, and religion. Born in Erfurt, Prussia, Weber grew up in an intellectually vibrant environment, which significantly influenced his scholarly pursuits.\nWeber studied law, history, economics, and philosophy at several universities, including Heidelberg and Berlin. His early academic career focused on law and economics, but he soon shifted to broader social sciences. He became a professor at the University of Freiburg and later at the University of Heidelberg.\nWeber’s most influential work, “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” (1905), argued that Protestant ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He is also known for his theory of bureaucracy, which described an ideal type of bureaucracy based on rational-legal authority, hierarchical structure, and formal rules and procedures.\nBeyond his academic contributions, Weber was actively involved in politics and participated in the drafting of the Weimar Constitution after World War I. His later works, such as “Economy and Society” and “Politics as a Vocation,” continued to explore the complexities of modern society, authority, and individual agency.\nWeber’s comprehensive approach to sociology, which integrated economic, political, and cultural dimensions, has left a lasting legacy, making him a foundational figure in the field. He passed away in Munich in 1920, but his ideas continue to influence sociological thought and research."

So, wherever possible, for each stage of your training guide, try to provide a mix of resources that meet the same learning objectives.\nConsider barriers to entry. Data scientists in large organisations may have access to training budgets or mechanisms to apply for training funds. But that isn’t the case for all data scientists, meaning that paid-for materials and training courses might not be accessible to everyone. Recommend them sparingly, and if there are ways to access the material at reduced rates do let users know. However, you must not link to illicit copies of material – e.g., unauthorised PDF reproductions of textbooks.\nIf there are resource gaps, please tell us. While planning out your training guide, you may well struggle to find the perfect piece of content to recommend at a particular stage of your learning journey. If that is the case, do get in touch with us. One of the goals of Real World Data Science is to identify and plug these sorts of gaps, so that all in the data science community can benefit.

For example, does your Explainer link to one of our published case studies? Does it focus on a tool or method that has been the subject of recent attention? Is it a foundational idea that is relevant to all sorts of data science applications?\n\n\n\nHigh-level summary\n\nA short, largely non-technical explanation of your topic. A good way to view this section is as an accessible condensed version of your complete Explainer. In thinking of it in this way, you can subtly signpost to audiences the areas you’ll be covering and the questions you’ll be answering throughout the remainder of your contribution.\n\n\n\nHistory and background\n\nIt can be useful from a practical perspective to explain how ideas, concepts, tools, and methods have developed over time. Applications may have become more complex in recent years, so exploring the origins of data science techniques might lead you to discover simpler use cases that can help support and illustrate your high-level summary.\n\n\n\nThe how, the when, the why\n\nThis section of your Explainer will likely be split into multiple subsections as you seek to build up your audience’s understanding of your chosen topic. It can be helpful to think about the sorts of questions an audience member might ask and to structure your contribution so that it directly addresses those questions (Q&A/FAQ formats are commonly used in explainer-type articles). If the focus of your Explainer is a data science method, for example, you’ll want to address the following:\n\n\n\nHow does it work and how is it applied (perhaps with an example or simulation)?\nWhat are the underlying assumptions?\nHow is performance checked and assessed?\nHow should outputs be interpreted?\nWhat are the pros and cons, the strengths and limitations of the approach?\nWhat are the optimal use cases, and when should the method be avoided altogether?\nAre there alternatives that people should know about?\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThis serves as your final summary: a chance to remind your audience of what they’ve learned from your Explainer and the main points they should keep in mind.\n\n\n\nTell me more\n\nIt’s sensible to assume that some of your audience will have further questions and will want to learn more about the topic. If you have additional sources of information to recommend, make sure to share them here."

Your Explainer can’t hope to explain everything, so you need to be clear about what’s essential for your audience to know and what isn’t. Make good use of links and references to point audiences to other valuable sources of information that can enrich their understanding of your topic.\nBe clear about your target audience and their expected prior level of knowledge. In keeping with the point above, you need to be clear in your own mind about how much you expect your audience to know already about the general topic or subject matter. You can then structure your contribution accordingly. It might also be helpful to state explicitly, at the outset of your contribution, what assumptions you’ve made about your audience and highlight any background reading that might be beneficial.\nPlan out your route. To help you decide what to cover in your Explainer, we recommend first writing out your high-level summary of the topic and also your key takeaways. This provides you with a start point (A) and an end point (B) for your contribution. The challenge then is to figure out the main points or questions you will need to address to help your audience progress from point A to point B in a way that’s logical and intuitive for them to follow."

When writing about data science tools and methods, for example, it can be helpful to start by outlining a typical application scenario or use case. Readers may be more familiar with the use case than the tool, so this provides valuable framing within which you can talk about the shortcomings of existing methods and the advances promised by the new research. Ultimately, you want to get readers to the point where they understand the problem, question or challenge that this new research paper aims to solve.\n\n\n\nResearch overview\n\nHere is where you summarise the work done by the paper’s authors. Remember to keep the discussion non-technical and jargon-free, and explain important terms and concepts as necessary. Be careful not to oversimplify!\n\n\n\nTakeaways and implications\n\nPut this paper and its contributions into the appropriate context for readers. Does it make modest but important improvements to existing knowledge or research processes? Will it help others to address new questions, issues and challenges? What further work is needed to build on these advances?\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nReaders may wish to learn more about the research or the broader subject matter, so feel free to point them to additional resources: videos, podcasts, textbooks, conference presentations, etc."

Establish the “client challenge” within that context, the resources available to the data scientist, and the outputs expected.\n\n\n\nGive users space to map the problem themselves\n\nHave users translate the “client challenge” into a data analytic question that can be answered using the resources available.\n\n\n\nMake data exploration, cleaning and tidying part of the process\n\nData exploration and preparation are an important part of most – if not all – data science projects, so let users loose on messy datasets so they can figure out for themselves (a) what they’re working with and (b) what analytical approach makes sense given the features of the data and the problem at hand.\n\n\n\nIntegrate ethics\n\nPrompt users to think about and work through ethical questions and issues that are relevant to the exercise: the challenge they’ve been set, the data they’ve been given, their proposed approach to analysis and modelling, etc.\n\n\n\nEncourage users to document their work and their thinking\n\nThrough computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter notebooks), users can record not only what they’ve done and how they’ve done it, but why.\n\n\n\nMake data presentation part of the expected project outputs\n\nAsk users to think about presenting to specific audiences: not just fellow data scientists, but to decision-makers, policy experts, the public – whatever makes most sense given the exercise scenario."

Explain how you proposed to tackle the problem, including an introduction, explanation and (possibly) a demonstration of the method, model or algorithm used. (NB: If you have a particular interest and expertise in the method, model or algorithm employed, including the history and development of the approach, please consider writing an Explainer article for us.) Discuss the pros and cons, strengths and limitations of the approach.\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nWalk audiences through the implementation process. Discuss any challenges you faced, the ethical questions you needed to ask and answer, and how you tested the approach to ensure that outcomes would be robust, unbiased, good quality, and aligned with the goals you set out to achieve.\n\n\n\nImpact\n\nHow successful was the project? Did you achieve your goals? How has the project benefited your organisation? How has the project benefited your team? Does it inform or pave the way for future projects?\n\n\n\nLearnings\n\nWhat are your key takeaways from the project?

Audiences are mostly interested in understanding the general use case and the problem-solving process you went through, to see how they might apply the same approach within their own organisations.\nGoals can be defined quite broadly. There’s no expectation that you set out your organisation’s short- or long-term targets. Instead, audiences need to know enough about what you want to do so they can understand what motivates your choice of approach.\nUse toy examples and synthetic data to good effect. We understand that – whether for commercial, legal or ethical reasons – it can be difficult or impossible to share real data in your case studies, or to describe the actual outputs of your work. However, there are many ways to share learnings and insights without divulging sensitive information. This blog post from Lyft uses hypotheticals, mathematical notation and synthetic data to explain the company’s approach to causal forecasting without revealing actual KPIs or data.\nPeople like to experiment, so encourage them to do so. Our platform allows you to embed code and to link that code to interactive coding environments like Google Colab. So if, for example, you want to explain a technique like bootstrapping, why not provide a code block so that audiences can run a bootstrapping simulation themselves.\nLeverage links. You can’t be expected to explain or cover every detail in one case study, so feel free to point audiences to other sources of information that can enrich their understanding: blogs, videos, journal articles, conference papers, etc."

The site has been designed from the ground up as a platform for data scientists, created by data scientists. Here’s what this means in practice:\n\nContributors can use data science software and tools to create content – e.g. Visual Studio Code, RStudio, Jupyter Lab; Python, R, Observable, and Shiny – allowing for the full integration of text, code, figures, equations, and other elements.\nReview and editing are transparent and collaborative, again making use of tools data scientists are familiar with – e.g. GitHub, Google Docs – for sharing and revising documents prior to publication.\nContent can be both engaging and interactive. Many data scientists learn by doing, so code can be made available as R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook files to be reused and experimented with offline. Or, the same documents can be used online through tools like Google Colab and Binder. Where appropriate, the use of interactive displays and Shiny apps is encouraged, allowing for data visualisations to be interrogated and regenerated on the fly.\nSite users are contributors too. Through annotation and commenting functionality, site users can interact and converse with authors and other members of the Real World Data Science community. And with all source files hosted on GitHub, users of our site can raise issues, or fork and propose improvements – leading to a true exchange of knowledge.\n\nFor more on how to work with Real World Data Science via GitHub, check out our repository README."

Engaging in discussions with users – whether through the Real World Data Science platform or via social media and other channels – is an effective way of developing an audience: it builds profile for the contributor and their content, and encourages other users to find and interact with content.\nContributors also have the option of uploading the source code and files for their articles to Zenodo, an open science repository, and submitting this material to the Real World Data Science community. When a Zenodo record is created, a DOI is assigned, and this DOI can then be added to your published article on Real World Data Science. For more details on working with Zenodo, see help.zenodo.org."

    "section": "Article types and structures",
    "text": "Article types and structures\n\nFeeds\nFeeds can be constructed around different topics and audiences. For example, you might want to recommend to all data scientists the “10 best blogs on machine learning” or “5 data visualisation experts to follow on Twitter/X”. Or you might have a list of sources specifically targeted at data science educators (e.g., “the best books on teaching coding”) or data science leaders (“5 insightful case studies on building data science teams”).\nWhatever you choose to focus on, the following outline provides a basic guide for structuring your feed:\n\n\nOverview\n\nA brief introduction to your list, its main focus, who you are writing it for, and why. You should also say something about yourself and your background, too. This will give additional context to the recommendations you are making.\n\n\n\nList of sources\n\nAs well as naming your sources and telling people how to find them, you should also explain why you are recommending them, how they helped you in your career or studies, or other reasons why you find them to be of value. Sample quotes or small excerpts from the sources themselves might also be worth including.\n\n\n\nStart a dialogue\n\nConclude with a call for readers to share recommendations of their own, either in the article comments or on social media. Contributors are welcome to update their lists any time with new sources, including those suggested by site users.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\nUnlike the feeds described above, each submitted review should focus only on a single publication. It must be an honest summary of the reviewer’s thoughts, feelings and impressions, covering what they liked and didn’t like, the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the publication, and whether it is likely to be of interest and value to its intended audience. Reviews should of course provide an overview of the publication in question but must avoid dry, itemised descriptions of the publication’s constituent parts (e.g., listing out the chapters in a book).\nAll reviews should list the following information (if relevant):\n\nTitle of publication\nAuthor(s)\nDate of publication\nEdition or format used for review\nPublisher\nLength\nPrice\nWebsite address or other source of further information"

Feeds are meant to help data scientists to prioritise who and what to follow based on their interests and career stage – and it is much easier to keep tabs on 5 sources than it is 50, or even 15! So, the fewer the better.\nKeep your recommendations up to date. In this era of digital publishing, things can and do change overnight. So, if one of your recommended bloggers stops blogging, or the author of one of your favourite books makes a major update to the text, do be sure to let us – and your audience – know. We want to keep feeds and reviews current and useful.\nOf course you are brilliant, but… Please do not recommend or review your own publications or those in which you have a pecuniary or similar interest."

    "text": "Technical content and jargon\nTechnical content is a necessary feature of a site like ours. Without it, an article or other piece of content may be of little practical use to a technical audience. But if there’s too much of it, even experts may struggle to stay engaged. Contributors are also faced with a dilemma when it comes to explaining technical content: explain nothing, and you risk alienating some of your audience; explain everything, and you’ll struggle to establish a clear, strong narrative thread. So, careful consideration is required:\n\nWho is my audience for this article?\nWhat is this audience likely to know already, and what needs to be explained?\nIf something needs to be explained, can I do so briefly and then link to other resources? Or is a full explanation required?\nIn telling my “story”, what are the absolute-need-to-knows, and what are the simply-nice-to-knows?\n\nThinking through these questions will help contributors to find the right mix of valuable, technical content paired with accessible, readable narrative.\nKeep in mind that the same general advice applies to the use of industry jargon. Jargon can be a valuable shorthand when communicating with people working in the same organisation or sector, but those working in different fields may struggle to make sense of it. So, contributors need to think carefully about how much jargon to use, and what needs to be explained."

    "text": "Marianne Weber (1870–1954) was a prominent German sociologist, women’s rights activist, and writer, known for her contributions to feminist theory and her role in advancing women’s rights in Germany. Born Marianne Schnitger in Oerlinghausen, she married Max Weber in 1893 and became an integral part of his intellectual and personal life.\nMarianne Weber was a formidable scholar in her own right. She studied law and sociology, and her academic pursuits were heavily influenced by the intellectual milieu she shared with her husband and other scholars of the time. Her work often intersected with issues of gender, law, and sociology.\nOne of her most significant contributions was her book “Wife and Mother in the Development of Law” (1907), where she examined the legal and social status of women through history. She argued for the recognition of women’s work within the family and their rights as individuals, advocating for legal reforms to ensure gender equality.\nIn addition to her academic work, Marianne Weber was actively involved in the women’s movement in Germany. She was a member of the Federation of German Women’s Associations (BDF) and served as its chairwoman from 1919 to 1923. During her tenure, she worked tirelessly to advance women’s educational opportunities, legal rights, and social positions.\nAfter Max Weber’s death in 1920, Marianne Weber dedicated herself to preserving and promoting his intellectual legacy. She edited and published his unfinished works, ensuring that his contributions to sociology and social theory would be recognized and studied by future generations.\nMarianne Weber’s life and work were characterized by her commitment to social justice, gender equality, and intellectual rigor. Her contributions have left a lasting impact on feminist theory and the sociology of gender, cementing her place as a significant figure in the history of sociology. She passed away in Heidelberg in 1954."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper describes a new specification of the justice evaluation function. It predicts precisely and unambiguously the kind of injustice (i.e., underreward or overreward) and the degree of injustice associated with given departures from perfect justice. The new justice evaluation function was inducted from extensive analyses of survey data on the perceived justice or injustice of earnings. It is directly generalizable to cover all socially distributed goods, and hence I propose it as a candidate for a universal Law of Justice Evaluation in distributional matters. Finally, I suggest that such a Law of Justice Evaluation performs one of the three tasks essential to a scientific theory of distributive justice."
