When I attended posit::conf(2023) in Chicago last year, I gave a talk about creating Real World Data Science using Quarto, the open source publishing system developed by Posit. That talk is now online, along with all the other conference talks and keynotes. 

My talk, "From Journalist to Coder: Creating a Web Publication with Quarto," is embedded below. You can also find a selection of talks on [our posit::conf highlights blog](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/09/19/positconf-blog.html). The [full conference playlist is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9HYL-VRX0oRFZslRGHwHuwea7SvAATHp).
