# Mail to RC42 community 13 sept

Dear RC42 Members,



I hope this email finds you well. My name is Juan Castillo, and as the president of RC42 (elected at the last ISA Conference in Melbourne 2023), I am delighted to connect with all of you and look forward to working together to advance our shared interests and goals within the International Sociological Association (ISA). This is my first time using the renewed ISA platform to communicate with all current RC42 members. I hope this interface will facilitate our future communications and keep us all better connected.



I am excited to announce the launch of our new website! This platform will serve as a central hub for all RC42 activities, providing updates, resources, and opportunities for collaboration. I encourage you to explore the site and share your feedback of this first draft version: https://isa-rc42.netlify.app/



We are also preparing our next newsletter, and I invite you to contribute! If you have recent publications, research projects, or news relevant to our community,  please send your contributions by this Friday to our board member Lisa Walker, lisa.walker@charlotte.edu. Your input will help us stay connected and informed about the great work happening within our network.



In addition, we have been working on the new statutes of the board, aiming to make our governance structure more inclusive and efficient. More details will be shared soon, and we welcome any input or suggestions you may have regarding these changes.



Finally, I encourage you to consider applying for our panels at the upcoming ISA conference. This is a fantastic opportunity to share your research and engage with colleagues worldwide. Details of our panels are coming in our newsletter.



Thank you for your continued commitment to RC42. I look forward to our collective efforts in the coming months!



Warm regards,



Juan Castillo  

President, RC42  

International Sociological Association
